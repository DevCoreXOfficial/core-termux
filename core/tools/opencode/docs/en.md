## What is it?

The open source coding agent.

## How to use it?

### Examples

```

### Agents

OpenCode includes two built-in agents you can switch between with the `Tab` key.

- **build** - Default, full-access agent for development work
- **plan** - Read-only agent for analysis and code exploration
  - Denies file edits by default
  - Asks permission before running bash commands
  - Ideal for exploring unfamiliar codebases or planning changes

Also included is a **general** subagent for complex searches and multistep tasks.
This is used internally and can be invoked using `@general` in messages.
